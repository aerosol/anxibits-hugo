I'm fed up with Apple and the direction they're taking.
I'm pretty sure they don't care about me as a user.

I don't think it's OK for
me to continue paying them the ridiculous amounts of money for some
mid-tier hardware and an okay-ish Unix flavour that does not cease to disappoint
with every release, at least since Tiger.

Also fuck new Macbook Pro keyboards. Using keyboards is what I do for love & living, 
that blasphemy won't affect me.

This year, I'm planning to spend my evenings on getting a usable Linux desktop,
just like the old days (TM).

I took some time to fiddle with various Linux distros on my Macbook,
mainly to see how efficient can I get, from scratch. 

I really love the keyboard setup Apple imposes. 
They got it right, it's a killer feature. A single GUI toolkit with clear,
unified design guidelines is what makes it great.

I'll gamble with [Solus Budgie](https://solus-project.com/) for the initial run. 
I like the effort a handful of developers are putting into it. 
I'll do my best to contribute.

I am getting ready -- the PC is on its way and it's damn powerful, yet
still way cheaper than this new Macbook with its stupid physical keyboard and ubiquitous 
latency I don't need. Nope, not going to pay for iMac Pro. Retina is surely great,
but full blown HiDPI support will eventually get there. I can afford a year of
evenings trying to get it right, with more cores underneath.

Using computers is all about that freedom to me.

There will be, hopefully, a series of blog posts of me struggling with the
final setup.

I already took some initial notes, links to further ramblings will appear here.
Stay tuned.

In RMS we trust. Or something.
